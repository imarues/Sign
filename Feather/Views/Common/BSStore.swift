//  The App Store's own language, rebuilt for this storefront: the palette, the
//  ground, the Today story card and the action pill.
//
//  Two things here are load-bearing rather than cosmetic:
//
//  * The story card measures its artwork before using it as a banner. AltStore
//    sources put a square app icon in the `headerURL` slot, and stretching one
//    across a 330-pt card is what turns a feed into a wall of blown-up icons.
//    Genuinely wide artwork is drawn sharp; anything else becomes the App
//    Store's blurred-artwork ground.
//
//  * The pill reports what is *actually* happening. A download reports its own
//    byte progress, and the install half is read from the system's own install
//    progress for the bundle id, so the pill never claims "done" for a package
//    that was only signed and never landed on the Home Screen.
